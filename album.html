                    <strong>Holding on to You</strong><br>
                    <strong>August 19, 2023</strong><br>
                    On this day, I prayed after many years.<br>
                    My life has been incredible. There is no space for complain. I've been the most privileged boy in this story, and I have to acknowledge it.<br>
                    Good family, good friends, good job, everything is good.<br>
                    I don't know what is happening, but I have to thank, because life is too good for me, you know.<br>
                    When I started to become a little intellectual, I think I distanced myself from God (more from religion than from God itself) a lot. But as I studied a lot more and life kept giving me these good things, I just noticed that it was really immature of me. I'm not religious at all, I'm just thankful.<br>
                    I keep trying to understand what is going on while I hold on to You.

                    <strong>Push</strong><br>
                    <strong>January 1, 2022</strong><br>
                    I assumed the role of president of the junior consulting company of the university.<br>
                    2022 was, indeed, a crazy and busy year. Being the president of IME Jr gave me lots of opportunities to grow some of my soft skills and create some stuff that I really wanted to build - such as a 100% free preparatory course for the entrance exams in the university, IMEnsina (something similiar to the one that I joined in 2017 for the high-school entrance exams).<br>
                    Pushing yourself into something you really want to do is, as I know, the best thing you can do to solve your own problems (everything becomes secondary), develop yourself (by pushing, itself) and be happy (because you want to do it).<br>
                    If things are easy, there are space for ordinary problems. If things are easy, you don't grow. If things are easy, don't settle.<br>
                    Being like this has always made me better and less fragile to this chaos.

                    <strong>May 21, 2021</strong><br>
                    Just got my first formal job as Junior Data Analyst in Shopee BR, a new e-commerce marketplace in the country.<br>
                    It was a challenge that I was really excited to face. The absence of challenge degrades the best of the best.

                    <strong>The one that gave me the life experiences</strong><br>
                    <strong>March 17, 2021</strong><br>
                    I received the message that I was accepted (and this time I'm able to to enroll) in the university that I wanted - Universidade de São Paulo, USP.<br>
                    Joining this university changed my personality a lot. Man, it triggered so many things in my life.<br>
                    But, since the beginning (since 2017), I understood that going to the university and learning are very different things, and I decided not to let the university get in the way of my own development. And that's a very important insight, you know? I feel that most people didn't understand it yet, and get limited by the formal educational system.<br>
                    Do not limit yourself. Push it.

                    <strong>The one that gave me time</strong><br>
                    <strong>February 26, 2020</strong><br>
                    I took the entrance exam for college in the end of 2019 to train and I got accepted. 2020 was quite a peculiar year for my academics.<br>
                    Once I was unable to enroll in college - as I didn't have a high school diploma -, I took 2020, taking advantage of the pandemic, to study like crazy for college subjects and the job market - which I already had a direction: data science.<br>
                    It was a really cool and pushy year - it was the first time I studied something because I really liked it, without any formal commitment to grades or things like that. I remember waking up at 4PM (yes) and going to sleep at 8AM (yes) studying derivatives and Python coding, I finished a lot of math books and data science courses. It was really fun back then (such a nerd).

                    <strong>The Ferris-wheel insight</strong><br>
                    <strong>December 30, 2018</strong><br>
                    A girl once told me that she was searching for reasons to live. And she asked me why we push so hard if one day we're going to leave. I told her that life is like a Ferris-wheel. And no, it's not because one moment we're up there and another time down - is better than this.<br>
                    When I was a kid, I was scared of going on roller coasters, and I liked going on the Ferris-wheel. There were few - I think two - times that I had the wonderful opportunity to climb on one. I only went on a roller coaster once, and it was one of those where the ride was a green caterpillar, for kids. Was cool.<br>
                    But the Ferris-wheel is a totally different ride from the other attractions in the amusement park. It's not funny. But there's always one in the parks and there are huge queues in it. The point is that the fun of the Ferris-wheel is not in it. The secret is in who you take with you. It's not about the Ferris wheel. It's about the cabin.<br>
                    With the right one(s), even the queue is worth it.<br>
                    And this is one of the strongest insights I ever had. I take it with me since then.<br>
                    And let me tell you - the Ferris-wheels in my life gave me more butterflies in my stomach than the roller coasters.

                    <strong>3 years</strong><br>
                    <strong>January 29, 2018</strong><br>
                    Everything went well. Just started my high school in a elite-level school in the city, which I battled a lot to be in.<br>
                    That first day is unforgettable. Is crazy how I remember a lot of details of this day - I really do miss this kind of feeling.<br>
                    It is really sad to acknowledge that these days are distant.<br>

                    <strong>Kenzo is (re)born</strong><br>
                    <strong>March 13, 2017</strong><br>
                    I think that doing a preparatory course to entrance exams in high schools was the best decision in my life.<br>
                    My parents didn't want to pay for my high school - they wanted to put in some public technical school, which is known as ETEC (Escola Técnica), here in the city. These schools are free and students also courses technical subjects - such as administration subjects, electronics, and so on. Students go through a selective process - a test - to study in a ETEC, and receives an extra diploma, technical in some field.<br>
                    I liked the idea, but immediately saw that the test was really challenging for me - and this shock changed my life. Noticing my failure as a student at my 13 aroused the strongest will I ever had. A will to change. A will to push. And that's why I decided to start a preparatory course to these exams - the first class was on March 13. I see this date as the end of my childhood.<br>
                    And it was the best decision of my life.

                    Nunca, jamais - em nenhuma hipótese - vá em uma roda-gigante sozinha. Escolha com muito carinho quem vai com você e saiba quem faz questão de ir com você também. Nunca esqueça dessas pessoas, e sempre as convide para que possam ver uma paisagem bem bonita lá de cima. Com a(s) pessoa(s) certa(s), até a fila vale a pena.

                    Amarre o tênis o mais forte que conseguir. Aprenda os melhores nós (e me ensine) e esteja sempre com bons cadarços - troque se for preciso. Se desamarrar, amarre de novo o mais rápido possível, aproveite para reforçar o outro laço e veja quem te espera até estar de volta. Sempre avise quando os tênis dos outros desamarrarem, e os espere até amarrar. Nunca ande com os tênis desamarrados, você pode tropeçar - e isso suja os cadarços.

                    Todos nascem como um coração pesado. Forte. Sempre que puder, verifique o peso do seu coração, pois corações leves são muito frágeis - eles podem se perder com o vento. E a vida assopra muito. Consiga deixar as janelas abertas sem que seu coração se perca - sentir um vento no rosto (e não perder seu coração) é libertador.

                <li>
                    Sempre (sempre, sempre e sempre) esteja querendo objetivos bem grandes, e queira o suficiente para pagar o preço de ir atrás deles - os queredores chegam muito longe. Os queredores querem tanto que conseguem o que querem - parece um super-poder. Seja (sempre) muito queredora, e você será uma conquistadora.

                    Busque entender a origem da palavra "recordar". Vem do latim "re-cordis", voltar a passar pelo coração.

                    Consiga conversar sobre tudo. Seja uma tudóloga. Conheça outros tudólogos e sempre converse com eles - reuniões entre tudólogos são sempre interessantes. Sempre tenha um por perto, sempre precisamos de um.

                    I need a friend to go to the Paramore concert with me next year. Positive points: Paramore show. Negative points: with me.<br>
                    It's really sad that I don't have anyone to go with me. I never went to a concert alone - it sounds kinda weird to me, idk.

                    It has a deep and beautiful message, man. I love this song.

                    The Weeknd is my favorite singer - it's been a while -, and Less Than Zero is my favorite from him. Man, I think this song is so beautiful.<br>
                    My singing ruined the video a little XD<br>
                    But I enjoyed it a lot at least :)

                    Btw, the fact that I can only play table tennis with a specific really bad racket - from the office - concerns me a little lol

                    I talked to an old friend from high school today. She was a mother for me back then - I miss you, Su. She was the school librarian, and I always loved talking to her. It's really pleasant to help who helped you in the past.<br>
                    Couldn't find a picture with her :c<br>
                    So, here's one of me in that library writing something that I may no longer understand. My earphones had some yellow tapes - a tøp fanboy.<br>
                    Man, I was really happy those days.

                    I found strong elements to make me more motivated on the academics. I was really disappointed with all that stuff, after spending lots of years dreaming with it. But the fact that people look up to me and that waking up 4AM dignifies you will give me strength to keep me going.<br>
                    It was never about finding maximum likelihood estimators. It's about enhancing others, giving the best of yourself, and crossing the city to sit in a chair that I cried to be in.<br>
                    I slowed down. But I'm back. And with a stronger purpose.<br>

                    Goodbyes is my favorite of his, and it's been on my mind since the 2019. Singing to this song in the rain was insane.<br>
                    The fact that some of the final "goodbye"s sounds like "come back" makes this song even better.

                    Hoje é meu aniversário. Os últimos 12 meses foram os melhores e mais felizes da minha vida, e eu estou - sem dúvidas - na melhor fase da minha vida até agora. Isso se deve, principalmente, pelas pessoas que estão comigo e fazem a minha vida ser o que ela é - aquela ideia da roda-gigante. Mas, sério: família boa, amizades boas, cabeça boa, saúde, trabalho, estudo. Não tenho o menor direito de reclamar da minha vida. Ela pode ser muito dura às vezes, mas ela foi muito boa comigo nesses (exatos) 20 anos.<br>
                    Que continue o desassossego.

                    Today, I was thinking about my past. It's really interesting to see how the experience of noticing my failure as a student at my 13 aroused the strongest will I ever had.<br>
                    There was another moment in my life, in the 2020 pandemic, that in the face of the pandemic impacting my formal education and my boredom I discovered what I wanted to work with, decided I was going to start working soon and entered the period of my life where I studied the most.<br>
                    And now I'm starting to feel it again.<br>
                    Where does this thing com from? I don't know if there's a name to it, ambition, willingness, idk - I call it "desassossego" or "vontade", in Portuguese. Why do I have it? Is it God? Is it the education my family gave me? I think I'll never know.<br>
                    I hope that someday I can help the young to grow this thing inside their veins too.

                    These days I was thinking about the future, and I think I would like to take a leadership position someday. I really enjoyed the experience I had last year.<br>
                    An MBA at Harvard or MIT someday would be cool. It's a bit early to think about it, but I don't know, it gives me a lot of motivation. I've always had the highest goals, and that's always been good for me. You just have to want it, don't you?

                    Paramore live is such a thing. Their songs are so beautiful and they have been with me for a long time, I would cry a lot in their show omg.

                    2 questions that got stuck in my mind these days:<br>
                    1. What do you think about giving books as a gift to someone?<br>
                    2. What do you think about getting to know somewhere by yourself alone?<br>
                    On the books question, I don't know what book to give to someone. Am I being too selfish giving a book that I think is cool? Is it too bad to give a book that you don't know if it's good? On the other one, I wouldn't like to know a place alone - idk, it has some sad vibes in this scenario for me. I would rather just talk in the sidewalk to someone I like. With the right one(s), even the line is worth it.<br>
                    By the way, today I bought a book to a friend, met a new place and took dinner - all alone. Is it peace and success for you?

                    I can't stand having nothing to do. Man, it makes me so bad.<br>
                    Going on vacation and not having anything to do is cool for, like, 2 days - after that, you stare at the ceiling so much that makes you start to wonder why it doesn't fall on your head.

                    My (first) vacation started this week, and it has been really nice. I took today to go to the university to see some friends, because I couldn't stand to stay at home staring at the ceiling anymore - having absolutely nothing to do is such a vibe, but not for too long.<br>
                    The University of São Paulo has beautiful landscapes, and reading a nice book or walking through them listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/UVzVUDXoi0Y" target="_blank">good music</a> is, indeed, a very nice experience.

                    It's important to always keep close those who talks about greatness and happiness all the time. These people brings joy, and makes us grow. Talking to them is like clearing a cloudy sky. People should take life more lightly, you know? These problems should not cover the sunlight. Life is hard, but life is so good, man. Isn't it true?<br>
                    Is there any sadness after listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/mRP72Ib2e9I" target="_blank">this song</a>?

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J7J_IWUhls" target="_blank">Paramore</a> is coming to Brazil after a long time. It's really sad that I don't have any friend to go with me to this show. Even though it's one of my favorite bands, I'd rather not go than going by myself - 'cause life's a ferris-wheel.<br>
                    On the ferris-wheel, it is a life-changing insight that I got some long time ago, what makes this no-go even sadder. I can talk about that with you someday.

                    I really enjoy life, friend, and noticing its subtle manifestations - laugh to a bad joke, having goosebumps when listening to a song, seeing the sun rise, feeling happy and missing seeing a dog run, miss talking to someone. Feeling happy with small things. Is there a place with more life? I think people lack that, having the will to live. A genuine will to live. This will shines in people.

                    It's been a long time since then. 5 years ago I had this hair and went to the first day of high school, and it's already far from today - even if it doesn't seem for me.<br>
                    Anyway, it's February/2023 already.

                    Remembered that I have a song in SoundCloud. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bruno-kenzo-593387143/circles-post-malone?si=83d0d8c705764638b909215416aceb38&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">our love went cold.</a><br>
                    It is a Post Malone song instrumental cover.

                    I'd like to call you on the way home<br>
                    Another precious call to waste on my mouth<br>
                    My chances tugging me by the shoulder<br>
                    But there's no one home to let you in or let me out<br>

                    I like to read the lyrics of songs and try to analyze them and understand what they mean. But I didn't get this one.

                    My shoulders right, my baby is all that I want<br>
                    I'll play them all of my favorite songs<br>
                    That lady is my favorite one<br>
                    <br>
                    I don't know why this song is called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3RjdVmny6A" target="_blank">Mariposa</a>" :p<br>
                    If anyone knows why, please tell me, 'cause I love this song.<br>
                    But it is a masterpiece, really cute. Definitely it should be in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUvxQqnky1FecTxlHXZXghQsKo0WcngzB" target="_blank">When the boys are not around</a> playlist.<br>

                    <br>
                    Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br>
                    I'd give it all just to hold you close<br>
                    Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br>
                    I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before<br>
                    I'll hold you down and not let you go<br>

                    I think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COz9lDCFHjw" target="_blank">Passionfruit by Drake</a> is my favorite song. I don't like Drake's songs that much, but this one gives me so many chills.<br>
                    I still remember how I met this song, back in 2017, through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqoj_3r9oqg" target="_blank">a Paramore cover</a> - which is a masterpiece, also.<br>
                    I kinda miss those times, but they lost their shine.<br>
                    <br>
                    That's me back in the days. I used to have a lot of hair, huh? I still wear this hoodie btw.

                    I was on the university today and something happened.<br>
                    There was a high-level-intellectuality atmosphere. I sat on the cafeteria, and the 3 tables that was occupied had someone with a maths book - I study Statistics. Then, I pulled a poetry book that I'm reading.<br>
                    I don't know, something happened at that moment.

                    Último dia de novembro! Os últimos dezembros foram todos bem doidos.

                    Faz tempo - uns meses - que eu não lia uma literatura boa não-técnica.

                    Hoje eu peguei o dia pra explorar o Keynote - PowerPoint do Mac. To gostanto, hein.<br>
                    Eu prefiro os programas de fazer slides (PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides) do que programas como Photoshop pra fazer artes.<br>
                    Acho que esses mais "profissionais" são melhores pra editar imagens (tirar fundo, iluminação e afins), mas não pra fazer posts, banners, etc. Enfim.

                    Lembrei de uma frase que um dos meus professores do Ensino Médio me disse, na primeira aula que eu tive com ele, lá em 2018.<br>
                    "A única diferença entre o aluno e o professor é o tempo".<br>
                    Talvez você nem lembre de ter falado essa frase pra mim, professor, mas ela me engrandeceu e me inspira até hoje.<br>
                    Ninguém é melhor que ninguém. Só começaram antes.

                    Prefiro as máquinas que servem para não funcionar:<br>
                    quando cheias de areia de formiga e musgo - elas podem um dia milagrar de flores.<br>
                    <br>
                    (Os objetos sem função têm muito apego pelo abandono.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Também as latrinas desprezadas que servem para ter grilos dentro - elas podem um dia milagrar violetas.<br>
                    <br>
                    (Eu sou beato em violetas.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Todas as coisas apropriadas ao abandono me religam a Deus.<br>
                    Senhor, eu tenho orgulho do imprestável!<br>

                    - BARROS, Manoel de. Livro Sobre Nada.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ontem foi um dia estranho. Uma sexta-feira desempolgante. Assim, achei que hoje seria um bom dia pra desaprender um pouco. Quem sabe, sabe.<br>
                    Peguei minha manhã desse sábado pra ler um pouco de poesia - coisa que eu não fazia faz um tempinho.<br>
                    Não sou tão chegado à poesia, acho que gosto mais de prosa, enfim. Meu livro favorito de poesia é "Livro Sobre Nada", do Manoel de Barros - e eu peguei pra ler um pouco ele hoje de novo.<br>
                    Esse poema tinha um significado diferente daquele que ele tem hoje. Engraçado como as coisas mudam. Até aquilo que tá impresso no papel.

                    #Junhou<br>
                    Saudades de uma festa junina, hein. Inclusive, a última que eu fui foi em 2018. Junhos são legais - saudades do de 2019. Saudades de 2019.<br>
                    Saudades. Junhou.

                    O painel de contribuições do GitHub pinta os dias relativamente a sua contribuição. Tem contas que com apenas 4 contribuições no dia o quadradinho já fica com o verde
                    mais escuro. Infelizmente, teve um triste dia que fiz um total de 96 commits (hehe), e agora quando eu tenho vários commits - tipo uns 15 - ele ainda não fica com o verde mais escuro.<br>
                    Sobre esse dia dos 96 commits: eu estava aprendendo ainda, e acho que eu fui mudando um README inúmeras vezes :p

                    Sobre conjuntos: se eu entendi bem a questão da bijeção, acho que podiam mudar o termo "enumerável" pra "ordenável" - fica mais intuitivo, ao meu ver.

                    Feliz dia do Vestibulando! Não é uma vida fácil, de fato.<br>
                    Queria que a maioria do pessoal conseguisse passar nas faculdades. Infelizmente, 2020 foi um ano meio esquisito. Mas tenho muito orgulho dos amiguinhos que passaram :D

                    Até que eu podia voltar com ele numa pegada voltada a dados. Não sei. Acho que não é esse o propósito dele - acredito que seja mais voltado à Matemática Pura & Filosofia, maybe.
